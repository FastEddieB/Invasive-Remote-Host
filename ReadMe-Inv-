My Samsung account is compromised. 
My Google account as well. 
As are my sync'ed social media and crypto accounts. 
Luckily all my digital accounts are nill or close 
to zero balance. I do not utilize any Amazon services. 
Nor have I. 
Initially my Samsung Account login/Samsung push 
service was back-to-back notifying me. I force stop-
ped all Samsung apps and system apps. It still 
pings me intermittently. 
My Find My Mobile app/Service is utilized every
 minute. I force stopped FindMyMobile, Fused 
Location & Geolocation Service. FindMyMobile
 is updated, reset and activated remotely by
 this data mining end user ec2-52-19-242-150

I'm running a VPN, firewall & [Google GPS] GPS
 spoof with nearly all possible Google framework
 2 way communications, reporting, notifications 
etc switched off. This malicious host opens 
those ports right back up. I can't keep them 
out. I can only sit back and watch them comprom-
ise my device.
